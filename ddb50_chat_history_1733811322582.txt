user: i accidentally closed all "bash" how do i get one back

assistant: You can open a new terminal by clicking on the terminal icon or using the menu options to open a new terminal window. If you're using Codespaces, you can also use the shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + ` (backtick) to open a new terminal.

user: what is backtick

assistant: A backtick is the character `, usually found on the same key as the tilde (~) on most keyboards, typically located in the top-left corner.

user: thanks!

user: SELECT title
FROM movies
WHERE year >= '2018';

for the third sql query in movies

assistant: It looks like you're trying to select movie titles from the year 2018 and later. Your query looks mostly correct, but remember that the year is an integer, not a string. Try removing the quotes around the year:

```sql
SELECT title
FROM movies
WHERE year >= 2018;
```

This should work!

user: it is coming up as red on check 50

assistant: Can you share the exact error message you're getting from check50? This will help us understand what might be going wrong.

user: :( 3.sql produces correct result
    expected "Avengers: Infi...", not "Ma Rainey's Bl..."

assistant: It looks like your query might be returning results in the wrong order. How can you modify your query to ensure the results are sorted by year and then by title?
