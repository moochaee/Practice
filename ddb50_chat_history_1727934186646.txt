user: expected function body after function declarator

assistant: It sounds like you might be missing the body of a function. Could you show me the function declaration and the code around it? This will help me understand the context and provide more specific guidance.

user: // Print an n-by-n grid of bricks

assistant: It looks like you have a comment describing what you want to do, but I don't see the function declaration or body. Could you provide the function declaration and any code you have so far? This will help me understand where the issue might be.

user: #include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main (void)

assistant: It looks like you have the start of your `main` function, but you're missing the body. You need to add curly braces `{}` to define the body of the function. For example:

```c
int main(void)
{
    // Your code here
}
```

What do you want the function to do inside the body?

user: #include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>

int main(void)
{
string = get_string("What's your name?\n");
}
{
    printf("%s\n");
}

assistant: It looks like there are a few issues with your code. Let's break it down:

1. You need to declare a variable to store the string.
2. The `printf` statement should be inside the same block as the `get_string` function.
3. The `printf` statement needs a format specifier and the variable to print.

Here's a hint on how to structure it:

```c
int main(void)
{
    string name = get_string("What's your name?\n");
    printf("Hello, %s\n", name);
}
```

Can you try to implement these changes and see if it works?
